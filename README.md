# README.md

This is a repository used to generate plots and other learning materials 
for AI courses, including ML and Data Science.

## Matplotlib & Seaborn plots

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python main.py`: contains a function to render all plots again, 
or a scratchpad to re-render specific plots.

## Code Snippets (ray.so)

The code examples for the slides can be found in ray.so_images. They are, 
of course, made with ray.so.

Settings:
- Theme: meadow
- Background: off
- Margin: 16px
- Languages used: Python, Markdown

This folder also contains code snippets used for the presentation. Some are 
just small snippets, others are fully functional scripts to play around with.

## Mermaid Diagrams

In the `mermaid` folder we store the syntax for the mermaid diagrams in `.md` files and store 
`.svg` and `.png` renders.

## Styling

Everything here uses styling from `colour_reference.md`, which contains the 
CodeCaf√© colours as well as some supporting colours to complete the palette.
