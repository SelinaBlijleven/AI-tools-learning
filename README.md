# README.md

## How To Run

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python main.py`: contains a function to render all plots again, 
or a scratchpad to re-render specific plots.

## Code Examples for Slides

The code examples for the slides can be found in ray.so_images. They are, 
of course, made with ray.so.

Settings:
- Theme: meadow
- Background: off
- Margin: 16px
- Languages used: Python, Markdown

This folder also contains code snippets used for the presentation. They are not full scripts 
and not intended to be used as such in most cases.

## Mermaid Diagrams for Slides

In the `mermaid` folder.

## Styling

Everything here uses styling from `colour_reference.md`, which contains the 
CodeCaf√© colours as well as some supporting colours to complete the palette.
